VISUAL by Gabriel Le To Ra

This website is intended to provide sound responsive visuals

1: Goto visuals.galetora.com
2: allow mic access
3: click and drag up to adjust threshold, until beats in song create effects
4: enjoy

Problems: The algorythym for beat detection relys on low frequency sound waves (Basssss baby) as most computer speakers output high frequency sound and most microphones seem to absorb high frequncy sound (unless they are physicaly attached to a sub), the algorythym doesn't get enough bass and often misses beats.
You cannot play music through other apps and use the website on phones :( 

Solution 1: this solutions isn't very nice and requires the user to do a lot of work, most users would turn away. You must download a virtual cable to loopback your audio ouput into your audio input. This is different for every device and probably not even possible on phones. 

HELP find a better solution to the problems
